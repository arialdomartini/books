Chapter 25. When can the right way be the wrong way?
====================================================

Behavioral researcher Wendy Joung and her colleagues wanted to know whether focusing the trainee on past errors that others have made would provide better training than focusing the thrainee on how others had made good decisions in the past.

Joung and her colleagues found that firefighters who underwent the error-based training showed improved judgment and were able to think more adaptively thatn those who underwent the error-free training.

Training is all about influencing others. Although many companies typically focus their training exclusively on the positive - in other words, on how to make good decisions - the result of this study suggest that a sizable portion of the training should be devolted to how others have made errors in the past and how those errors could have been (and can be) avoided. Specifically, case studies, videaos, illustrations and personal testimonials of mistakes should be followed by a discussion of what actions would have been appropriate to take in these and similar situations.
